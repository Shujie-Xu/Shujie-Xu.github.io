I am a master's student in Applied Economics (CUHK) and Social & Economic Policy (Northwestern), graduating December 2025.

My research examines how **information frictions** and **institutional contexts** shape firm behavior and market outcomes. I combine computational text analysis with causal inference methods to study strategic decision-making in corporate and urban settings.

Currently, I work with **Prof. Franklin Qian** at UNC Kenan-Flagler studying housing market dynamics. Previously, I worked with **Prof. Letian Zhang** at Harvard Business School (now Northwestern Kellogg) on political economy, and **Prof. Yue Tang** at SWUFE on corporate finance.

My undergraduate thesis examined corporate political engagement using natural language processing on earnings calls and policy documents.

**I am applying for Economics PhD programs for Fall 2026.**

**Research Interests:** Applied Microeconomics, Corporate Finance, Urban Economics  
**Methods:** Natural language processing, causal inference, computational text analysis
