## Working Papers

### Political Attention, Partisan Alignment, and Corporate Performance
*Undergraduate Thesis, May 2024*  
**Advisor:** Prof. Yue Tang (SWUFE)

I develop text-based measures of corporate political engagement using earnings call transcripts and examine their relationship with firm performance. Using Word2Vec embeddings and semi-supervised learning on 220M+ tokens, I construct firm-level measures of Political Attention and Partisan Alignment.

**Key Finding:** A 1-percentage-point increase in Political Attention is associated with 2.0pp higher ROA, with 15.8% of this effect mediated through lobbying expenditures.
