I am a joint master's student in Applied Economics (CUHK) and Social & Economic Policy (Northwestern), graduating in December 2025. I study how information design and institutional constraints shape firm and household behavior, with current projects spanning urban economics, corporate finance, and political economy.

My work builds text-based measures at research scale. I design NLP pipelines for MLS listings, corporate filings, and political speeches, use them to test economic mechanisms, and pair these measures with administrative and transaction datasets through careful matching strategies.

Right now, I lead the measurement agenda for a housing bargaining project with Franklin Qian, building seller sorting indices and demographic heterogeneity tests. I also construct political leader and speech datasets with Letian Zhang to study how leadership transitions steer corporate investment and human capital decisions.

When not coding, I'm often sketching ideas for my next field project or hunting for new ways to bring text evidence into economic models.
