I study how information design and institutional constraints shape firm and household behavior. Across urban, corporate finance, and political economy settings, I build large-scale text pipelines—MLS listings, annual reports, earnings calls, political speeches—and fuse them with administrative data to test economic mechanisms directly.

Right now I lead the measurement agenda for a housing bargaining project with Franklin Qian, build political-institution datasets with Letian Zhang, and extend supply-chain risk work with Yue Tang. I'm especially interested in bringing text-based evidence into models of bargaining, sorting, and organizational choice.

I am pursuing full-time pre-doctoral RA placements that launch in Summer 2026 to keep scaling these measurement-driven projects before doctoral study. I plan to apply to Economics PhD programs in the future and welcome conversations about research assistant opportunities and collaborations.
