title: "About"
---

I am a master's student in Applied Economics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Social & Economic Policy at Northwestern University (expected Dec. 2025). 

My research examines how **information frictions** and **institutional contexts** shape firm behavior and market outcomes. I use computational methods—particularly natural language processing—to study corporate decision-making and market dynamics.

Before graduate school, I worked with Prof. Yue Tang at SWUFE studying supply chain risk and corporate political engagement.

**I am applying for Economics PhD programs for Fall 2026 admission.**
